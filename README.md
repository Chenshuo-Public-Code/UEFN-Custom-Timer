# UEFN-Custom-Timer
UEFN verse Custom Countdown Timer - with callback functions

I've created a custom timer class to replace the timer device in the game.

I've added a lot of functionality to it. We can register events in this timer for a callback every second, and a callback at the end of the timer (similar to the broadcast-listener pattern).

We can also have the Timer displayed on the UI. Moreover, I've also added an urgency mode (the text will turn red).

You asked me why I rewrote the timer deviceï¼Ÿ because the original timer device in the game CANNOT BE MODIFIED!

For example, I've added a custom UI to the code, so that we can change its position, add backgrounds, etc.

Even if we don't need that functionality, we can still register a secondly timer event in another location to perform the function we want.

And it doesn't need to be placed in the game, it just needs to be referenced in the code, making it neater.

Here is the full code snippet:
